Code for CodeMash 2025 Divez Session - So you want to make video games? - Super Sky Squadron II: The Flying Ace Follies

In order to get the most out of the session, it is strongly advisable that the pre-requisites are completed prior to the session starting.  It is even more advisable to complete the pre-requisites before coming to CodeMash as you and every other attendee will be fighting for bandwidth and some setups (chromebook) might take a long time for downloads.

## Pre-Requisites

A laptop capable of running python3 with pygame-ce and installing various pip packages, and running some type of editor.
